# prj6220
This is created for ITEC6220 Project Graph Database Benchmark: 
ArangoDB vs MongoDB vs OrientDB vs Neo4j

Basic ideas: By using the same datasets, same query workload, and same enviroment cross validation of result each graph database's benchmark.

Datasets:

Part I Bitcoin Alpha trust weighted signed network 

This is who-trusts-whom network of people who trade using Bitcoin on a platform called Bitcoin Alpha. Since Bitcoin users are anonymous, there is a need to maintain a record of users' reputation to prevent transactions with fraudulent and risky users. Members of Bitcoin Alpha rate other members in a scale of -10 (total distrust) to +10 (total trust) in steps of 1. This is the first explicit weighted signed directed network available for research.

Part II Infrastructure Canada Projects 

As for now we only completed ArangoDB and MongoDB comparing based on this dataset. Index and search text by using Infrastructure Canada Projects Data. The publisher - Current Organization Name: Infrastructure Canada, This dataset contains a list of infrastructure projects across Canada that have been approved by Infrastructure Canada. The project information listed is based on current information.

The report will be sent upon request.
