This article documents the details on how to reproduce the graph database benchmark result on Neo4j. 

Datasets
=========

Part I Bitcoin Alpha trust weighted signed network 

This is who-trusts-whom network of people who trade using Bitcoin on a platform called Bitcoin Alpha. Since Bitcoin users are anonymous, there is a need to maintain a record of users' reputation to prevent transactions with fraudulent and risky users. Members of Bitcoin Alpha rate other members in a scale of -10 (total distrust) to +10 (total trust) in steps of 1. This is the first explicit weighted signed directed network available for research.
